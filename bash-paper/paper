Parallel Functional Shell Programming
Jason Catena
5 August 2008

Higher-order functions modularize, simplify, and parallelize programs.
This paper presents, as literate programs, shell script variations of
the higher-order functions compose, conditional, construct, filter,
fold, map, unfold, and zip.  GNU Make implicitly parallelizes construct,
map, and zip, for the most practical benefit.  We apply these higher-
order scripts to, and in, a small library of utility scripts.

Introduction

Higher-order functions assist functional programming in the POSIXⁱ
shell language.  The language already supports some key operations on
first-class functions: scripts⁲ can pass, modify (to subclass, or apply
an aspect), and execute other shell scripts.

 ⁲ Scripts are loosely functions, since they take any number of parameters,
and return a numeric value (a number in the shell variable $?) and
textual values (standard output and standard error).  Mathematical
functions can be defined as maps, from a domain set, to a single value
of a range set.
	The language supports anonymous functions, in the form of
shell commands passed as text strings, without any type-checking or
safety.  Since these do not use a lambda notation, they are limited to
commands which take a member of the data set as their last parameter.
We usually want to place any interesting functionality in actual files,
so we can vary and reuse it.
	Of course, shell scripts are all about side-effects, so the
language is in no way strictly functional, nor does it provide any
abstraction, isolation, or safety for side-effects or reasoning about
correctness.

	Lambda calculus

Fraser⁳ defines an operator, μAV(E), over A: a set of arguments;
V: a set of parameters (a context); and E: the expression of a function
in terms of the arguments, to apply to the parameter context.
When fully evaluated, this new form yields the same value as (λA.E)V,
a similarly constructed lambda expression with applied parameters.
The difference is that μ varies the expression over a persistent
context, while λ varies the parameters over a constant function.

programming systems.  Communications of the ACM 14, 6 (Jun),

	Fraser uses this equivalence to define a notation and algebra
for operations over a file system, in terms of programming language
constructs.


Predicate selects function to apply to value

The script cond applies a predicate function script to a value,
to choose one of two other function scripts to apply to the value.

	Cond—functional conditional

EXTRACT cond
	predicate="$1"
	true="$2"
	false="$3"
	value="$4"
	
	if "$predicate" "$value" >/dev/null
	then "$true" "$value"
	else "$false" "$value"
	fi


Apply function to each member of list

The higher-order function map applies the function named by the first
parameter to each of the remaining parameters.  The script map applies
its function script parameter to each of its other value parameters,
and executes all scripts in parallel with gmake.

	Lambda calculus

Jung⁴ and Sebasta⁵ provide notation⁶ to define map with a lambda
expression (id est, the content of a function, without a name).
The function apply-to-all (α) takes two parameters: the function f,
and the set S.
 ⁴ §4 in Jung, A.  2004.  A short introduction to the lambda calculus.
http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/\u223caxj/pub/papers/lambda-calculus.pdf
 ⁵ Pp. 455–457 in Sebasta, R.W.  1993.  Concepts of Programming
Languages, 2nd ed.  Computer Science.  Benjamin/Cummings.
 ⁶ α(f,S) ≡ (λy.λx.x y) f s, ∀s ∈ S
	By definition, it applies f and s (a member in S) to a lambda
expression, which applies its first parameter x (f) as a function to
its second parameter y (one value of s).
	The applied expression returns another set, which contains as
members each value returned by applying f to the corresponding member
s in S. Category theory defines functor as this mapping between sets.

	Category theory

Our dependence⁷ on set theory notation in the previous section leads
us to the functors of category theory.
 ⁷ Even if only motivated by a lack of knowledge of the lambda calculus.
	Sheard and Fegaras⁸ define map for type list,⁹ neatly phrased
as a constructive activity. This style informs LISP implementations.

 ⁹ map^list (f) Nil = Nil
map^list (f) (Cons(a,l)) = (Cons(f a,map^list (f) l)

	Lisp

Sebastaⁱ⁰ defines mapcarⁱⁱ with a lambda expression in Pure LISP.
 ⁱ⁰ P. 471 in Sebasta, R. W.  1993.  Concepts of Programming
Languages, 2nd ed.  Computer Science.  Benjamin/Cummings.
 ⁱⁱ (DEFINE (
	’(mapcar (LAMBDA (fun lis)
		(cond
			((NULL lis) ())
			(T (CONS
				(fun (CAR lis))
				(mapcar fun (CDR lis))
			))
		)
	))
))

Our LISP definition rephrases Hudak.ⁱ⁲ We named it jmapcar
because GNU Emacs LISP already has a mapcar function.
 ⁱ⁲ P. 368 in Hudak, P.  1989.  Conception, evolution, and application
of functional programming languages.  ACM Computing Surveys 21, 3,
359–411.  http://doi.acm.org/10.1145/72551.72554

EXTRACT jmapcar.el
	(defun jmapcar (f l)
		(if (null l)
			nil
			(cons (funcall f (car l))
				(jmapcar f (cdr l))
			)
		)
	)

For example, (jmapcar ’cdr ’((a b c) (d e f))) evaluates to ((b c) (e f))
in GNU Emacs 21.3.1.

	Mas—serial

Use this version of map to manipulate text.

EXTRACT mas
	f=$1
	shift
	for x in "$@"; do
		$f $x
	done

	Maf—anonymous functions

Use this version of map to supply pipelines as the first parameter.

EXTRACT maf
	fsh=/tmp/f.$(basename $0).tmp.$$
	echo $1 > $fsh
	chmod +x $fsh
	shift
	
	for x in "$@"; do
		$fsh $x
	done
	
	rm -f $fsh

For example, strip the final extensions from filenames.

$ maf "echo \$1 | sed 's,\.[^.]\+$,,'" a.c b.c c.c d.c
a
b
c
d

	Map—parallel

If the function passed to map has no side-effects, then map can apply
the function to all parameters at once.  We can implement this by
constructing a makefile with a pattern-matching rule which executes
the function on a word.

EXTRACT map.mk
	%.map: %
		echo $<

Use this version of map to execute shell commands.  It requires that
each of its parameters be a file.  Exit if there are no parameters,
or no more than the function name.

EXTRACT map
	case $# in
		0|1) exit 1 ;;
	esac
	
	mkf=/tmp/mk.$(basename $0).tmp.$$
	f=$1
	shift
	
	sed "s,echo,$f," $(dirname $0)/map.mk > $mkf
	make -s -j -f $mkf $(echo $* | sed 's, ,.map ,g;s,$,.map,')
	
	rm -f $mkf

This version once ran at least three times slower (90-100s total build
time) than the script version (30s), when I tried to replace six calls:
applying suffixes to files (twice), adding echo commands to makefiles,
printing the name and first line of files, applying a set of transforms
to a set of files, and applying a transform to a set of files.
	This version did speed up the noweb -t function over the
non-core noweb files, by completely parallelizing the operation.

	Comap—parallel, switch order of arguments

Use this version of map with compose, when the target file is constant,
but the name of the function varies.
	Takes only two arguments, for now, as part of the compose pipeline.

EXTRACT comap
	case $# in
		0|1) exit 1 ;;
	esac
	
	mkf=/tmp/mk.$(basename $0).tmp.$$
	f=$2
	
	sed "s,echo,$f," $(dirname $0)/map.mk > $mkf
	make -s -j -f $mkf $(echo $1 | sed 's, ,.map ,g;s,$,.map,')
	
	rm -f $mkf


Reduce list by predicate

The higher-order function filter applies the predicate function named
by the first parameter to each of the remaining parameters, reducing
the set to those values for which the predicate holds.  The script
filter applies its function script parameter to each of its other
value parameters, returning the value if the function script returns 0
(true for the shell).


Colophon

This document was typed into Acme running in Inferno on Linux Mint.
It was transcribed from a LaTeX and noweb literate program written on
a Red Hat linux machine, using the tufte-latex article document class.

The font file used during its transcription maps the Unicode point
range 0x2070 to 0x208E to font pelm/supsub.9.  This font file supplies
superscript 1, 2, and 3 at code points 0x2071, 0x2072, and 0x2073,
respectively, where they fit better (as part of the range: superscript 0
at 0x2070, to superscript 9 at 0x2079) than a superscript i and two
empty characters.

Used these Edit commands in Acme to generate the table of contents.
New sections require two passes: one to add new lines to the table,
and another to adjust the line numbers to count the new lines.

Edit ,x/\n\n.+[^.]\n\n/ x/.+\n/ {
=
p
}
Edit ,x/\n\nEXTRACT .+\n/ x/.+\n/ {
=
p
}

Run these Edit commands on the output lines to produce the exact
format in the Contents section.

Edit x/^.+paper:[0-9]+\n.+/ s,\n,	,
Edit x/^.+paper/ s,.*,  paper,g
